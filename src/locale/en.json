      "bolic": "Hey Comp Sci, hope you're having a <strong>CSSLAY</strong> day! I'm the-ideal-candidate-for-VP-Communications, but you can call me Natasa. Many CS students are missing out on opportunities provided by the CSSA simply because they don't know what's available. My goal as VP Communications would be to make this <strong>information more accessible and organized</strong>, without overwhelming you with content. To do so, I aim to improve the primary methods of communication between you and the CSSA—(1) the email, (2) the Instagram account and (3) the website:\n\n1. I will put <strong>labels</strong> at the start of emails (i.e. social event, academic event, etc.) so that you only spend time reading what you're interested in. I'll also implement an <strong>easily clickable</strong> option to add CSSA events/deadlines to your calendar.\n\n2. I will post a <strong>summary of upcoming events</strong> on Instagram at the start of every month to create more <strong>awareness</strong> of plans within the CSSA.\n\n3. I will create <strong>blog posts</strong> on the website with key information from the emails to form a <strong>centralized space</strong> with upcoming CSSA events/deadlines.\n\nI have experience managing communications for a student organization, as well as practice sharing information concisely from debate tournaments. I'm also proficient in both official languages, notably having received a French subject award in secondary school. Most importantly, you don't want to miss out on the jokes I'd add to the emails. If you have any questions or comments, message me at nboli039@uottawa.ca or @natasabolic on Instagram, I'd love to chat! :)",
      "koffi": "Hi everybody,\n\nI am Audrey Koffi, a second year student in Computer Science. I am running for the position of Vice-President of Equity, within the Association of Computer Science Students.\n\nI firmly trust that I can understand and accept differences, show empathy to those around me, but also be open-minded.\n\nFor all these reasons, I believe that I am the right fit for the position I am running for.  Not only am I aware that we all have a duty to foster equity within the student community, but I am also convinced that this requires an enabling environment for freedom of expression of minorities, which are often underrepresented.\n\nAs Vice-President, I will focus on equity information sessions to facilitate access to information. I will also concentrate on improving equity communication by conducting surveys of marginalized groups in order to identify their specific needs and provide tailored solutions. In addition to this, I plan to launch a mentoring program that will match Computer Science students with the goal of sharing experience and allowing them to learn from each other, in a context that fits them and suits their goals.\n\nMotivated and determined, I would like to reaffirm that I am firmly committed to represent you as Vice-President of Equity. I pledge to fulfil this role with excellence, and to do my best to ensure that Inclusion and Equity reign supreme both within and outside our Association.",
      "states": "Hello, my name is Connor States, I am running for the vice president of communications for the Computer Science Student Association.  I feel that I am cut out for this position as I believe communication is an essential part of any organization. Not only is it a necessity to relay vital information, but the way the CSSA communicates through social media platforms is important. If done properly it can demonstrate the charisma and infectious energy that I know this faculty has, and I feel I have the ability to do so. I believe I have an advantage that comes from being a bilingual student who received all prior education in Quebec. Another strength I have is my experience in terms of leadership from coaching various sports throughout high school. I hope to be a resource to the CSSA in its future endeavours.",
      "mostefai": "Equity. Equality. Justice. Words and stuff. What does it all mean? What even is a VP Equity? And most importantly, why should you, dear voter, care?\n\nA whole lot of years ago, a bunch of people (they're called the UN or something) banded together and dropped the hottest universal declaration of human rights to ever exist. Recent developments show “human rights” extends to students too! Neat, right?\n\n“Wha--my rights?” you might say, new to the concept of having rights, “who's gonna advocate for those?”\n\nAllow me to introduce myself. I'm Meriem; a plucky young CS student, presumably just like you! Your new voice for the voiceless. Your resident ear to complain to. Your reliable shoulder to cry on-and I have *two* shoulders.\n\nLike our VP Social accounts for 101ers, the VP Logistics accounts for merch, and the VP Finance accounts, your VP Equity accounts… for you!\n\nAs your VP Equity, I'd make sure nobody gets left out. No matter what, you'll always be welcome to let me know if you need any resources, and I'll be more than glad to provide them. I'm at your service!\n\nSo vote Meriem for VP Equity, because I donated to Wikipedia once and that was really cool of me.\n\nAlso because I'm asking really nicies.",
      "mujeebuddin": "Hello!\n\nI'm Manaal Mujeebuddin, and I am running to be your Vice-President of Communications. I believe that I am the ideal candidate for this position. As you all know, communication is vital to ensure a positive environment where CSSA and the student body can thrive and have fun together.\n\nMoreover, as a multilingual student, I can communicate with the English, French, Arab, and the Desi community.\n\nAs Vice-President of communications, it will be my duty to announce and promote all events organized by CSSA. I am very passionate about this role, especially since CSSA is a prominent organization dedicated to offering students an exciting and memorable experience.\n\nCSSA has had a significant impact on my first year at the university. I am very excited to put my experience to use and expand the reach of CSSA so that other students may also experience that long-lasting impact. My goal is to continue and expand the outreach of CSSA to ensure all students are well-informed and equipped.\n\nI also plan to work with other student organizations to ensure that students get as many opportunities as possible. I am confident I will be a valuable addition to the team, bringing energy, fresh ideas, and good communication!\n\nI am looking forward to communicating with you!",

I think I am cut out for this position as I have already had the opportunity to manage the academic events and affairs of various student clubs and associations, as I was the Junior Vice President of Academic Affairs for CSSA for the 21/22 academic year. If I am elected Vice President of Academic Affair, I will focus on holding meaningful and beneficial events for Comp Sci students, events such as networking opportunities and exam reviews!",
      "wang": "Organization is the foundation for any great association, the bedrock that everything is built on top of. CSSA is a shining city on a hill, but who will be strong enough to keep it that way? I'm Justin Wang, and I'm running for VP Logistics. Our first moments in life were spent with the joys of counting, plucking each finger up as we counted each digit. From those special moments, I knew logistics, out of everything, was my calling. My experience helping run festivals in Toronto and making sure tours and BBQs at my high school ran smoothly make me a veteran of the craft. With all your support and confidence, I know our events will have the proper equipment, our office hours will be well thought out. And to all unaccounted merch and other inventory, let me tell you this; YOU, WILL, BE, COUNTED! I wasn't here on campus first year. The confusion and stress I felt watching the university and facilities fumble basic things made me realize how chaotic things can be. Now that I'm here, I will not allow my beloved CSSA to go through the same thing. My eyesight might be terrible, but my vision is CRYSTAL CLEAR. So come election time, there is one thing you should remember, BETTER VOTE WANG.",

Now that I've grown older, bolder, and donned my signature orange hoodie, I see my future lying ahead of me (because that's how futures work). As a second year Computer Science and Mathematics student, VP Logistics just seemed to draw me in with its promises of numbers and... more numbers.\n\nAs VP Logistics, I plan to continue to keep accurate inventory of official CSSA merchandise (sold at the CSSA office located at SITE4076 for $25-30), along with ensuring no CSSA property gets lost in the concrete jungle of the uOttawa campus. Plus, with me being a determined perfectionist, if something needs to get done, then it's guaranteed to get done.\n\nThat being said, if you like having board games at LAN parties as much as I like hating linear algebra, we'll get along just fine.\n\nTo put it simply, at the end of the day, I'm never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around, or desert you. I'm never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye, never gonna tell a lie, or hurt you (in the context of the CSSA, of course).\n\nVote Timothy Mao, orange hoodie enthusiast.",

Working behind the scenes, I will ensure that events such as 101 Week continue to be both enjoyable and memorable for students. In addition to annual CSSA events, I plan to collaborate with other student organizations to bring new in-person events to students as well.\n\nNext, I will improve how CSSA equipment is organized and tracked by maintaining records of equipment and materials that are used by the organization. Additionally, I will ensure that key services such as merchandise sales and office hours remain accessible and available to computer science students.\n\nNext, I will improve how CSSA equipment is organized and tracked by maintaining records of equipment and materials that are used by the organization.
