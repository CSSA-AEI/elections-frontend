      "meherete": "Hi! My name is Chris, and I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student born and raised in Ottawa! I want to help foster a fun and supportive community for all Computer Science students at the University of Ottawa. Being a student is difficult enough already, but it especially has been in the past couple of years. I wish to help alleviate the stress of student life by assisting CSSA in being a student association that students feel comfortable relying on for advice, fellowship, as well as events and activities. As Vice President Internal Affairs, I hope to create a fun and safe environment for students at the CSSA office in SITE. This will be a place for students to work on school work, and meet and hangout with other Computer Science students (plus there will be snacks of course (: )!",
      "bagga": "My name is Vanisha Bagga and I am finishing my second year in Computer Science at UOttawa. I desire to provide educational and social resources that are accessible for students to enhance their experience at university. Since I have only experienced university during the pandemic, I entered not knowing how I was going to meet classmates or get academic help. Fortunately, CSSA helped me have a university experience that was close to normal. CSSA provided activities I could go to that helped me make connections while also staying safe. They were there for questions I had about my program or university. My goal is to be that person for future first years who come to UOttawa. This past year, I assisted with CSI 101 Week as a guide to support the first years. As VP of Executive Affairs, I want to take it one step further. I wish to use my experience as a first-year student during COVID to bring ideas to life that will enhance student life for computer science students. I am an approachable and social person who wants to be the helping hand for computer science students at UOttawa to create a supportive computer science community."
