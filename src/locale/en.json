I am rerunning for this position as I want to continue the CSSA’s mission in being an association that cares for its students. \n\nI want to continue to bring more learning, social, and equitable opportunities to the students of Computer Science, and to the Faculty of Engineering as a whole. I believe I can accomplish this by working alongside the academic, social, and equity VPs to make the CSSA-AEI a safe and thriving place for students. Making connections with your peers is important, and I believe I am the right choice to facilitate the ongoing growth and maturation of the CSSA-AEI and its members.When voting this election, make your vote count by voting for Laura Hornar for President of the Computer Science Student Association!",
      "abubaker": "Hello, My name is Omer Abubaker and I am running to be VP Financial Advisor for the Computer Science Student Association!\n\nI believe that I am fit for the position because I have had previous experience managing the finances of various student clubs and associations. I have also had volunteer work experience in an accounting firm preparing financial reports/statements. If I am elected as VP Finance, I will not only focus on the finances of the association but also work with other executive members to create more events and help the CSSA get sponsorships to allow students have more connections with the tech industry and much more.",
      "chatterjee": "Hello there! My name is Sat, a 2nd year Computer Science student here at uOttawa! I'm running for VP Academic for 2021-2022!\n\nHaving been part of the CSSA in the past, I have planned multiple events such as workshops and review sessions aimed at guiding students academically, and I will continue to do so! I have also been able to take action regarding issues faced by students of our university. Some of these important issues include the mental health of students during the quarantine period, standing against concerning online proctoring methods, and much more. While I strive to address these issues regardless of my position at the CSSA, I believe that being a part of it allows me to act much more effectively on behalf of the students, and better serve the community of our university.\n\nI strongly believe in the transparency between the university and the students, as well as promoting easier communication between the students and the faculty. I've strived for that throughout my journey so far as a VP Academic, and I hope to continue doing the same throughout this upcoming term!",

      "karpov": "Hi everyone! My name is Elian Karpov and I'm super excited to be running to be your VP Internal again!\n\nAs VP Internal this year, I had the pleasure of hosting social events such as movie and game nights, and being part of our virtual and in-person 101 Week. I’m also proud to have expanded our options for hoodie sales, and I hope to add even more merchandise options beyond hoodies next year. As we transition back to in-person learning this fall, I plan to keep the office a clean and comfortable space for students to study and hang out in. Since going online, it has been especially hard for first year students to get involved or meet other students, so another goal I have for the upcoming year is to get our first year students that are entering their second year more involved with campus life. I’ve really enjoyed my time on the CSSA team this past year and I loved meeting so many amazing people through our events. I look forward to representing you as the VP Internal of the CSSA for the upcoming school year!",
      "salehi": "Hello everyone! My name is Kian, third year student, and I am running for the position of VP External Affairs on the CSSA.\n\nIt would be a pleasure to represent my computer science colleagues while organizing professional activities and events, such as; job fairs, that raise awareness about new technology opportunities, such as Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Cybersecurity. I also would love to create a social platform respectively to Computer Science students which includes new undergraduate students. This would benefit our juniors and seniors in career opportunities, and events for our future upcoming computer scientists. I invite you all to take the time and vote on March 31st - April 2nd. If you have any questions or concerns don’t hesitate to contact me!",
      "langhe": "Hello my name is Shreya and I am running to be your VP Philanthropy for 2021-2022!\n\nI was the VP Phil this year and, if I am re-elected, I plan to do even more fun events like: movie nights, game nights, collaborations with other associations, and of course Shinorama! There will be fundraisers for BLM, cystic fibrosis, men's cancer and much more. I like to focus on fundraisers that contribute to/support the advancement of computer science and technology - seeing as we are in a computer science program after all. Last year we did a movie night to raise donations for Black Founders, an organization that supports black entrepreneurs in the tech industry. Of course these donations are not limited to just my preference of fundraisers. I will always be open to other fundraising event ideas and organizations too!",
