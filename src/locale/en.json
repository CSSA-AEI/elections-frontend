As the VP Social, I have hosted and contributed to many successful events such as 101 Week, LAN Parties, Montreal Takeovers, Hack the Hill, and more!\n\nIf elected, my focus will be on building closer relationships with various student groups on campus to provide more learning and leadership opportunities to computer science undergraduates. We have already had great collaborations with student organizations, and I want to expand this effort to include more student-run clubs and competitive engineering teams.\n\nWith my experience in event planning and networking, I plan to build on the CSSA's existing relationships with companies to bring more networking events to campus.\n\nI also believe in increasing the CSSA's transparency to improve communication with students. I plan to make budgets and minutes easily accessible so more students can partake in our ongoings.\n\nAdditionally, I want to strengthen our relationship with the faculty to improve student experience academically and socially in the Faculty of Engineering.\n\nWith my experience, dedication, and commitment, I am confident that I can lead the CSSA to new heights.

      "dimatulac": "Hello! I'm Cedric, a CS student who loves Kirby, Ghibli movies and attending LAN parties. I've been involved with CSSA for some time now, attending events and serving as a guide during 101 week, and would like to become more involved by becoming VP Internal. In this role, I'd be responsible for overseeing the organization's in-office operations, which includes maintaining a tidy space, accounting for supplies and documents, and ensuring that everyone feels comfortable when in the office.\n\nYou know, while we've been out here working our butts off studying for midterms, grinding assignments, and just being stressed about life, I've realized that it's essential to have a space on campus to relax. The CSSA office provided that space for me. Its cozy atmosphere made not just for a good place to study, but also a good place to talk with friends and have fun, aided further by the lovely people here. I want to ensure that all of you can share the sense of comfort I feel there.\n\nSo why vote for me? I know the CSSA office like the back of my hand. I know exactly how to make it more lively, like bringing more snacks, adding more Switch games, and redecorating for each holiday--changes that I promise to implement as VP Internal. That doesn't mean I'll forget my organizational duties of filing documents efficiently and ensuring office records are organized either, and I'm open to any suggestions to improve the office!\n\nNot convinced? Well, here are just a few of my achievements:\n-Aced probability by cramming for 48 hours\n-Loudest karaoke singer\n-4th best Smash player in Ottawa and the best Canadian Kirby player\n\nVote for me and I'll guarantee you do well on your next midterm! (Not actually but I'll still give you words of encouragement!)",

      "hassan": "Hi, I'm Sami, a second year CS student running for VP Internal Affairs. I'm running because I  think getting involved and making connections is important, especially after a few years of being  online for school. If elected as your VP Internal, I am committed to ensuring all in-office  services provided by the CSSA are running as smoothly as possible.\n\nI believe that maintaining a clean and orderly office space is crucial for any productive work  environment. I pledge to ensure that the CSSA office is always well-maintained and presentable.  I will work to develop a system for regular cleaning and organization of the office space to make  sure the office is in its best condition. I would also develop eco-friendly practices in the office,  such as minimizing paper usage, a proper recycling system and reducing energy consumption. \n\nThe CSSA office should not exclusively be an environment for association affairs, but also a  place for students to chill for a bit, get some studying done during an intense school day with any  essentials they may need for the day right at their fingertips. I pledge to keep the office supplied  with not just basic office supplies and stationary, but first aid, gum/mints, an electric kettle (with  tea and ramen packs included of course) in accessible locations. \n\nI also recognize the importance of accessibility when it comes to CSSA business documents. I  understand that taking forever to find something that you know is in the room you're in is not  fun. As VP Internal Affairs, I will make it a priority to ensure that all documents pertaining to  CSSA business are filed in a manner that is accessible to all members.\n\nI hope these 300 words and my posters on @sami4vpinternal on Instagram convince you to vote  Sami for VP Internal!",

I am eager to collaborate with you all and I am looking forward to helping every single one of you with resources and connections you require in your career paths.

Aside from that I will communicate with the university services on whatever questions or concerns you might have.

      "lee": "As a first year, I feel like I have to prove myself in many aspects; I have yet to earn my seat at the table. That is why I am the ideal candidate for vice president of philanthropy. I work tirelessly to achieve the goals I set for myself and those I share with others; I am very collaborative and enjoy interacting with people of various backgrounds.\n\nFor example, this past October, I volunteered with uOttawa WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) for their Women in the Workplace event. I helped interested students in setting up their LinkedIn accounts, additionally showing them the features the platform provides, such as easy job application and skill tests, to name a few. I thoroughly enjoy helping others and providing resources as accessibility and security, especially job security, are topics I care about deeply.\n\nAs vice president of philanthropy, I intend on participating in and initiating appropriate philanthropic activities. For example, fundraising for social causes, student projects, and holding donation events. In regards to the donation events, I would like to host an electronics donation event where students can donate used/gently used items. In addition, during final exams, hosting mental health clinics to ensure students have access to resources to help them through the stressful time.\n\nFurthermore, I will not only work hard to ensure the success of myself and others, but I care very deeply. Though my compassion may be seen as both an asset and a detriment, I know as vice president of philanthropy, I will represent the CSSA well and accomplish the goals we set. ",
